# WAV Metadata Manager

A tool for managing metadata of WAV files and renaming them according to the [Universal Category System (UCS)](https://universalcategorysystem.com/) based on embedded metadata.

This tool uses a metadata and naming system inspired by Kai Paquin‚Äôs conventions, with modifications for personal workflows.
